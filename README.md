Credit card customer analysis, 

Churn Prediction using unsupervised Machine learning.

This project is done in a series of phases, the first of which involves an exploratory data analysis, 
where the objective is to know the nature of the variables and to examine attributes that indicate a strong relationship with leaving credit card services. 
The next phase involves applying a machine-learning algorithm to find the best properties for building the model. 
At the end of the project, after finishing all steps, a machine learning model will be utilized, adept at predicting, based on the data of a structure, 
whether a customer will cancel the credit card service or not.
